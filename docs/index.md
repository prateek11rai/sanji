# Hi!

I am Prateek. Part-time techie and full-time football/soccer fan. I created this site to document my projects and thoughts. I occasionally read too. Currently obsessed about anything [Yukio Mishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima). [^1]

[^1]: Why is the site called [Sanji](./blog/posts/sanji.md)?
